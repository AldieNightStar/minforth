# Labels and Jumps

## Note
* Label used to jump into some logic position



## Create label
* Since now compiler will know that there are label `start`
* It will be accessible from __all code__
```
start:
```





## Jump onto label
* Just add `!` at end of the word
* If we want to jump onto `start` we use `start!`
```
start!
```
